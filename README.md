Using external and open resources along with personal code, this program
generates a set of convex polygons and navigates from start to finish
using only visible points along the way.

Classes and descriptions:
ConvexHull.cc / .h (Look at credits for source)
 - These are used to create convex polygons (specified in project).
Geometry.cc / .h
 - This class organizes points generated by the convexHull algorithm
 - and allows checking of edges for visibility.
