Compile command:
g++ main.cc ConvexHull.cc Geometry.cc -o ai_proj

then execute ai_proj.


Description:
Using external and open resources along with personal code, this program generates a set of convex polygons and navigates from start to finish using only visible points along the way.

The polygons created are made from creating a convex hull from randomly generated points in a specified area. To generate regular shapes, set "regular" to true


Classes:
ConvexHull.cc / .h (Look at credits for source)
 - These are used to create convex polygons (specified in project).
Geometry.cc / .h
 - This class organizes points generated by the convexHull algorithm
 - and allows checking of edges for visibility.
